RunningBunny
A 3D Mobile VR Game built with Unity3D

This is a single player game created using Unity3D. In the game, the player will control a small rabbit to dodge from trees by going left, right or jumping, using either a simple VR device like the GoogleCardboard. Each player has three lives, and loses one life when he/she hits a tree. The further the rabbit goes, the faster the rabbit will run, and the higher the score will be. The player with the highest score is considered to be the winner.
