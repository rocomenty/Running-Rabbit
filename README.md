RunningRabbit
Web VR Game

This is a single player game created using Three.js and WebGL. In the game, the player will control a small rabbit to dodge the obstacles in the forest like stones, trees, and small lakes, by going left, right or jumping, using either a VR device or simply the arrow keys on the keyboard. The further the rabbit goes, the higher the score will be. The player with the highest score is considered to be the winner. The game can be run directly from a Chrome or Firefox browser, which gives the players some cool VR experience and saves them from the need to download a large file like normal VR games.
